            </div>
            <div class="infoDiv">
                <p>Aquanow is a fintech company that creates platforms that enable institutions and enterprises to use and transact with digital assets. Headquartered in Vancouver, BC, Aquanow serves over 200 institutional clients from over 30 countries around the world.</p>
                <p>From January to April 2022, I was the Visual Designer at Aquanow. My contributions to the company include redesigning main site visuals, creating infographics, and designing the information architecture of web-app documentation.</p>
                <p>Below is a showcase of a few projects I completed for Aquanow that are published for public viewing. Due to contractual reasons, I can not disclose detailed process photos, nor my work on internal-facing applications, but I hope you enjoy what I have to show.</p>

            <h2>Main Website Icons</h2>
            <p>I created a series of artwork and icons, all adhering to an original art style I designed that conveys Aquanow’s brand identity. This work is viewable on the main company website, <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.aquanow.io/">aquanow.io</a></p>
            <p>Icons were sketched in Procreate, then vectorized in Adobe Illustrator.</p>

                <h2>Aquapay Documentation</h2>
                <p>I designed the information structure, various pieces of vector artwork, infographics, diagrams, and a favicon logo for the <a class="hyperlink" href="https://docs.aquapay.io/">Aquapay web app’s documentation site</a>.</p>
                <p>Although the variety of my work for this project was quite expansive, I worked on every piece through a similar process. Everything started with research and sketching, then vector work in Adobe Illustrator, and then Figma to organize all the layouts together. Weaved between these steps were feedback sessions with my supervisor to gain critique and direction for what to focus on next.</p>

            <h2>Takeaways from my Internship Experience</h2>
            <p>As my first Industry work experience, my internship at Aquanow taught me a lot about working as a designer in a team of other designers, as well as developers and managers. I held design workshops, created and resolved Jira tickets, presented my designs to upper management, and worked with developers to design visuals and app features that fit the needs of users.</p>
            <p>I am extremely grateful to my supervisors and everyone else at the company I worked with. Everyone was extremely welcoming, patient, and kind towards me, encouraging me throughout this journey of a work term to grow into a better and more confident designer.</p>
